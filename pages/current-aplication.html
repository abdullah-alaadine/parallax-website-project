                Although the education sector is the one most influenced by humans,
                Artificial Intelligence has slowly begun to seep its roots into the
                education sector as well. Even in the education sector, this slow
                transition of Artificial Intelligence has helped increase productivity
                among faculties and helped them concentrate more on students than office or administration work.

                Digitization of content like video lectures, conferences, and textbook
                guides can be made using Artificial Intelligence. We can apply different
                interfaces like animations and learning content through customization for
                students from different grades.Artificial Intelligence helps create a rich
                learning experience by generating and providing audio and video summaries
                and integral lesson plans.
