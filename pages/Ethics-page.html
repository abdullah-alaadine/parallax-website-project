                As we enjoy the advantages that come with AI. Let’s not forget one of the
                major disadvantages which is creation of unemployment. As we invent ways
                to automate jobs, we should also invent ways to create more jobs for humans
                so that the economy will be balanced. Imagine what will happen when robots
                take over the whole workforce, what will then be the faith of humans? </p>

                <span class="bold">Privacy and Surveillance: </span>
                The use of artificial intelligence has limited people’s right to privacy as there
                are many spywares online that can be used to spy on people’s privacy without their
                consent. Governments make use of AI surveillance and facial recognitions to run their
                intelligence agency and this infringes on people’s privacy right.

                <span class="bold">Security: </span>
                In this period when countries are building nuclear weapons of mass destruction,
                how do we regulate what is out there. We need to invest more on cyber security
                and regulations that will regulate hackers, and use of weapons of mass destruction
                so as to save and preserve mankind. This is because the fight is against systems
                that are proving to be smarter, and more capable than us by orders of magnitude.
