            <p class="parag1"><span class="bold">Unemployment: </span>
                As we enjoy the advantages that come with AI. Let’s not forget one of the
                 major disadvantages which is creation of unemployment. As we invent ways
                  to automate jobs, we should also invent ways to create more jobs for humans
                   so that the economy will be balanced. Imagine what will happen when robots
                    take over the whole workforce, what will then be the faith of humans? </p>

                <span class="bold">Privacy and Surveillance: </span>
                The use of artificial intelligence has limited people’s right to privacy as there
                 are many spywares online that can be used to spy on people’s privacy without their 
                 consent. Governments make use of AI surveillance and facial recognitions to run their
                  intelligence agency and this infringes on people’s privacy right.

                <span class="bold">Security: </span>
                In this period when countries are building nuclear weapons of mass destruction,
                 how do we regulate what is out there. We need to invest more on cyber security
                  and regulations that will regulate hackers, and use of weapons of mass destruction
                   so as to save and preserve mankind. This is because the fight is against systems 
                   that are proving to be smarter, and more capable than us by orders of magnitude.
