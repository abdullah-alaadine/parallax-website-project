            <p class="future-parag1"><span class="bold">AI-powered nannies</span> are expected to revolutionize
                child-rearing by providing 24/7
                personalized care and education. With
                the ability to monitor a child's activities, an AI nanny can provide real-time updates and
                recommendations to parents,
                ensuring the child's needs are met. The AI nanny can also create a customized curriculum based on the
                child's learning
                style and interests, offering interactive lessons, games, and activities to engage the child and help
                them learn new
                skills. Additionally, the AI nanny can provide increased safety by detecting potential hazards, offer
                convenience for
                parents with more flexibility in their schedules, and even emotional support and companionship for
                children who may need
                it.</p>
