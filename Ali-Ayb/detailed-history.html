            <p class="history-parag1">Alan Turing, widely regarded as the
                father of modern computing, laid the
                foundation for the development
                of AI with his
                groundbreaking work on machine intelligence in 1942. During World War II, he created the first computing
                machine, which
                was used to crack Nazi codes and ultimately played a crucial role in the Allies' victory. This early
                work on machine
                intelligence set the stage for decades of research and development that has led to the advanced AI
                technologies we see
                today, with applications in healthcare, finance, transportation, and many other industries.</p>
