            <p class="history-parag1"><span class="bold">Alan Turing</span>, widely regarded as the
                father of modern computing, laid the
                foundation for the development
                of AI with his
                groundbreaking work on machine intelligence in 1942. During World War II, he created the first computing
                machine, which
                was used to crack Nazi codes and ultimately played a crucial role in the Allies' victory. This early
                work on machine
                intelligence set the stage for decades of research and development that has led to the advanced AI
                technologies we see
                today, with applications in healthcare, finance, transportation, and many other industries.</p>

            <p class="history-parag2">In 1997, IBM's Deep Blue made history by <span class="bold">defeating world chess
                    champion</span> Garry
                Kasparov in a six-game match. This marked
                a significant milestone in the development of AI, as it demonstrated that computers could be programmed
                to outthink and
                outmaneuver the best human players in a game that was widely considered a benchmark for human
                intelligence. The
                technology behind Deep Blue's success paved the way for further advancements in AI, including the
                development of machine
                learning algorithms and neural networks that are capable of analyzing vast amounts of data and making
                decisions based on
                that analysis.</p>

            <p class="history-parag3">In 2016, <span class="bold">Google DeepMind's AlphaGo</span> made a major
                breakthrough in the development of
                AI by beating the world's strongest
                Go player, Lee Sedol, in a five-game match held at the Four Seasons Hotel in Seoul's Gwanghwamun
                district. The game of
                Go was considered by many to be too complex for computers to master, due to the game's vast number of
                possible moves and
                the importance of intuition and strategic thinking. AlphaGo's victory marked a significant milestone in
                the development
                of AI, demonstrating that machines could be programmed to excel at tasks that require creativity and
                intuition. The
                achievement also paved the way for further breakthroughs in AI research and development, with potential
                applications in
                fields such as medicine, finance, and environmental science.</p>
